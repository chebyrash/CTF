.Nm Introduction


Microsoft Paint allows you to produce your own pictures (or edit existing
ones). In Windows XP, you can no longer access Paint directly from the
Microsoft Office applications; instead, you insert the picture file or copy and
paste the picture directly from Paint.
Note that pictures and drawings are fundamentally different. A picture is
composed of a fine grid of coloured dots (pixels), whereas a drawing is
composed of lines and areas. If you paste a drawing into a painting
program, its component units (the lines etc) are lost - they become a series
of individual dots. To create a drawing you need to use Microsoft Draw (see
A Guide to Microsoft Draw for details).

Starting up Microsoft Paint
To run Microsoft Paint independently:
1. Open the Windows Start menu, select Programs then Accessories
and finally Paint
2. [Maximize] the window so that the Paint window fills the screen
Your screen should now appear as below:

The white area on the screen is your painting canvas, below this is a palette
of 28 colours, while to the left is a toolbox. Many of the tools in the toolbox
match those in Microsoft Draw but they don't all behave in exactly the same
way.

Fundamentals
Before you start to explore the toolbox, it's important to understand several
fundamental aspects of using a painting package. The major difference
between this and a drawing package is that once a line or shape has been
drawn it cannot be edited in the same way. You cannot, for example,
lengthen a line, nor can you change its style or colour. Further, the line
cannot be moved independently of its surroundings, neither can the order of
objects be changed (whatever is drawn last is what appears in the picture).
With this in mind, you have to set up line thickness and colour before you
draw an object. Then, if you fail to draw the object precisely in the right
place, you have to use Undo (<Ctrl z>) to erase it and then try again. When
creating a picture you will find you have to use Undo quite frequently!
Setting the Canvas Size

The canvas consists of a fine grid of pixels. You can see individual pixels
and can display the grid by using the magnification facility, as you will see
later. This can help considerably if accurate drawing is required.
To increase the size of your canvas you can simply drag out the edges to
the required size using the mouse on the canvas handles. These are
positioned at each corner of the canvas and half-way along each side. You
can also set it precisely via the Image menu.
1. Position the mouse cursor over one of the canvas handles on the right
or bottom edge - use the bottom right corner handle to change both the
width and the height
Note that within the picture itself the current grid coordinates of the mouse
cursor (which currently appears as a pencil) area displayed at the foot of
the screen). You can use these to help you draw accurately. Outside the
canvas area, the mouse cursor appears in its usual arrow shape. Only
when it is placed exactly over one of the canvas handles does it become a
two-headed arrow.

2. Hold down the mouse button and drag the mouse outwards (or
inwards) - note how the new size is displayed by the coordinates at the
foot of the screen
3. Release the mouse button when the canvas is the required size
It's not that easy to reset the canvas size this way - an easier method is to
set up the size via the menu system:
4. Open the Image menu and select Attributes... - the following window
appears:

5. Under Units decide whether you want to define the size in Inches, Cm
or Pixels
6. Now set up the Width and Height - here change it to 500 by 400 pixels
7. Press <Return> for [OK] and the canvas is resized
Note: If you increase the size of your canvas, the additional area will
appear in whatever background colour is set at the time. For this reason, it's
a good idea to set this up before you mess around with the colour settings.
Setting the Foreground/Background Colours

At any one time, you have only two colours which you can use to draw an
object. In Paint these are known as the foreground colour and background
colour. These are the two colours shown to the left of the palette. The top
square (currently black) denotes the foreground colour, while the partiallyhidden lower square (currently white) denotes the background colour. If you
draw a solid shape, the surrounding line is drawn in the foreground colour,
with the fill in the background colour.
To draw another object in a different colour you have to change the current
foreground and/or background colours before you start drawing. This is

done simply by clicking with the left (for foreground) or right (for
background) mouse buttons on the palette. You can also use these buttons
when drawing to reverse the normal colours - if you draw a line using the
right mouse button, it appears in the background colour.
To change the default drawing colours:
1. Position the mouse cursor over the required foreground colour in the
palette and click on the left mouse button
2. For the background colour, repeat step 1 but click using the right
mouse button
You will find that the small squares to the left of the colour palette now
match your choices. It's important that you don't select the same colour for
both the foreground and background. You will learn later how to change the
colours available to you in the palette itself.
Setting the Line Thickness

To change the thickness of the line being used for drawing:
Line

1. Click on the [Line] button in the toolbox - a selection of 5 line
thicknesses appears below the toolbox (the default is 1 pixel wide, the
next down is 2 pixels ... up to 5 pixels at the bottom)
2. Select the required line thickness
Note: this is the thickness of the line that will be used when drawing shapes
(lines, rectangles, ellipses etc). If you draw freehand using the pencil or
brush then this setting is ignored.

The Basic Tools
The six tools in the bottom three rows of the toolbox provide you with basic
drawing facilities. These give you lines, curves, rectangles & squares,
polygons, ovals & circles and rounded rectangles respectively. The exercise
which follows uses these in turn:
1. Click on the first of the six buttons - [Line]
2. Before you draw any object, check that the line thickness and
foreground colour are correct

3. Move the mouse cursor to where you would like to draw a line (use the
grid coordinates for accuracy) then hold down the left mouse button
and move the mouse around
4. As the mouse is moved the coordinates change and an elastic line
appears, starting at the position where you first held down the mouse
button and ending at the current position of the cursor
5. Position the cursor where you want the line to end then release the
mouse button - a line appears in the current foreground colour and
chosen thickness
The same principle works when drawing rectangles, ellipses and rounded
rectangles:
6.
7.
8.
9.

Check that the line thickness and foreground colour are correct
Click on the [Rectangle] button immediately below [Line]
Repeat steps 3 to 5 - this time an elastic rectangle appears
Next click on the [Ellipse] button (below [Rectangle]) and repeat the
above
10. Finally try out the [Rounded Rectangle] to the right of [Ellipse]
Tip: If you want to draw a square or circle, hold down the <Shift> key as
you drag out the shape.
The next button up (on the right) is for a polygon.
11. Set the required line thickness and foreground colour then click on the
[Polygon] button
12. Begin the polygon by dragging out the first side (as if you were drawing
a line)
13. Release the mouse button to fix the line
14. For the second side, position the mouse cursor roughly where you
want the next corner to appear and hold down the mouse button
15. Move the mouse to make any fine adjustments then release the mouse
button to fix the line
16. Repeat steps 14 and 15 for further sides of the polygon
Note that you can also continue dragging out the sides (at step 14) if you
want to see the side as it's being drawn. By holding down the <Shift> key
as you draw the lines you can restrict them to horizontal, vertical and
diagonal directions only.

17. Double click on the mouse button (at the last corner, without moving
the mouse cursor) and a final line will be drawn back to the starting
point
The final tool in this group draws curves. To use this, you first define the
start and end points of the curve and then bend the straight line to form the
required curve. You can have a maximum of two bends in any curve.
18. Set the required line thickness and foreground colour then click on the
[Curve] button
19. Position the mouse cursor where you want the curve to begin then drag
out a straight line
20. Release the mouse button when you reach the position for the end of
the curve
21. Place the mouse cursor to one side of the line then hold down the
mouse button - the line becomes a curve
22. Move the mouse around until the curve is as required then release the
mouse button
23. If required, repeat steps 21 and 22 on the other side of the line to
create a second bend in the curve
Note: If you create the initial straight line for the curve by clicking at the
start and end (instead of dragging out the line) the resultant line is doubled.
As you then apply the curve it becomes an enclosed loop (a teardrop).
Drawing Solid Shapes

All the shapes you have drawn so far have been transparent - just the
outline appears with no fill. For all the area shapes (ie not lines or curves),
you can also draw them as solids, with the background colour used as the
fill. To do this you have to choose a different shape style:
1. Set the required line thickness and foreground/background (fill)
colours, as before
2. Click on one of the area tool buttons - eg [Ellipse]
A choice of three fill styles is now available; these are shown beneath the
toolbox. The top one (the default) gives you a transparent shape - the line is
drawn but there is no fill. The middle one draws both the line (using the
foreground colour) and fills the shape (with the background colour). The
bottom one draws a filled shape using just the foreground colour. You have
already seen the default - try the other two:

3. Click on the middle Fill Style button
4. Now draw an ellipse as you did previously - you'll find it's filled with the
background colour
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 using the bottom Fill Style button - again the
shape is filled with colour but this time there is no border line
Exactly the same choices are available for the other area shapes. You will
see later how to colour fill an existing unfilled shape.
Reversing the Colours

If you use the right mouse button when drawing a shape (or line), the
colours are reversed - the background colour is used for the line and the
foreground colour for the fill.
1. Click on the middle Fill Style button
2. Hold down the right mouse button and drag out the ellipse as before you'll find the colours have been reversed
3. Try using the right mouse button to draw other shapes - eg a line or
curve
Note that you can also invert all the colours in the picture - so that black
becomes white, blue turns yellow and red changes to cyan.
4. Open the Image menu and select Invert Colors
5. Repeat step 4 to return the colours to their original state
Text Boxes

To add text to a picture, a text tool is provided. This is shown as A and is
located immediately above the [Curve] button.
1. Click on the [Text] button
Note the two options which appear below the toolbox. The top (default)
setting is for a filled text box, the lower option is for text in a transparent
box. The foreground colour is used for the text itself; the background colour
for the fill.
2. Set the foreground/background colours and select a transparent text
box, if required
3. Point the mouse cursor to where you want the text to appear, hold
down the mouse button and drag out a rectangular frame roughly the
size you want for the text (then release the mouse button)

If you just click with the mouse then a very small text box appears. A
special Fonts floating toolbar is displayed:

4. Select the required font and font size and set up bold/italic/underline (if
required)
5. Click inside the text box and type in your text - as you type, the words
wrap within the width of the frame which grows in size downwards as
you type
6. Using the handles, adjust the width/height of the frame - this cannot be
made smaller than its original dimensions
Take great care when attempting this as if you click outside the frame, the
lettering is fixed and you have to Undo and start again. Only while the
handles are displayed is the frame still active. In this state you can edit the
text, change the font or its size and reset the foreground/background
colours if necessary. You can even switch between a filled box and a
transparent one.
Tip: You can move the whole frame by dragging first one side then the
opposite side.
Note: Text in a text box can only be in one font, in a fixed size and colour,
and attributes such as bold/italic are applied to all of the text. Use the Fonts
toolbar to change these settings.
7. Click away from the text box when you have finished making all your
adjustments
The Pencil, Brush and Airbrush

The next three tools in the toolbox provide you with a pencil, brush and
airbrush. These allow you to draw freehand shapes or colour part of your
picture. They all work in roughly the same way but produce lines/areas of
varying size. Start by using the pencil:
1. Set up the required foreground colour for your pencil (you can also
draw in the background colour by using the right mouse button)
2. Click on the [Pencil] button

A pencil draws a line one pixel high, irrespective of the current line width
setting.
3. Position the mouse cursor where you would like to start your drawing
4. Hold down the mouse button and as you move the mouse a freehand
line is drawn
5. Release the mouse button when you have finished drawing your line
6. If your line is a mess, press <Ctrl z> for Undo and try again
The brush works in much the same way except that it gives a thicker line:
7. Set up the required colour as in step 1 then click on the [Brush] button
A set of 12 brush styles appears below the toolbox. The top row gives you a
circular brush, the second a square one. The next two rows give you
diagonal lines to paint with - using these you can create effects similar to an
italic pen nib. For each type of brush you have three widths. For the circular
brush these are 7, 4 and 1 pixel wide (left to right); for the others they are 8,
5 and 2 pixels.
8. Select a brush type and width then repeat steps 3 to 6, as above
The final tool, the airbrush, works in a slightly different way. As you move
the mouse around a fine spray of colour is applied to the canvas. The
intensity of the colour can be increased by moving the mouse more slowly
across the canvas or by spraying the same area over and over again.
9. Repeat step 7 but this time click on the [Airbrush] button
With this tool you have 3 different styles - from an intensive spray over a
small area to a more scattered spray over a larger one.
10. Select the type of spray required then repeat steps 3 to 6, as above
Note: the cursor takes on the same form as the button image. The lowest
point of the spray coming out of the can marks the centre of the spray. If
you click the mouse button once when using the spray then you get a circle
of spray centred on that point. You can also click when the brush is
selected to get small circles or squares, or when the pencil is active to
produce a single pixel of colour. You will see later how to use these to
produce accurate drawings.

Editing a Picture

You cannot edit a picture in the same way that you can a drawing.
Remember that a picture is composed of a grid of tiny squares (pixels), not
of solid objects. Essentially you have to edit each pixel, either one at a time
or in groups. To help you with this, several further tools are provided.
Colour Fill

You can fill an area with colour using the [Fill with Color] toolbar button.
This essentially replaces one area of colour with another. All areas are
coloured - even a white background. The area which can be filled is defined
as contiguous pixels in the same colour. If, for example, a line crosses a
circle then each half of the circle constitutes a different area and has to be
filled separately. Great care has to be taken when filling polygons and
freeform shapes - if the area is not completely enclosed, the fill will leak out
and flood the whole background of the picture.
1. Select the required fill colour from the palette - the foreground colour is
used by default
2. Click on the [Fill with Color] toolbar button - second row on the right
This looks similar to the [Airbrush] and works in a similar way in that the
cursor now matches the icon with the active spot marked by the tip of the
paint spilling out of the can.
3. Position the mouse cursor so that the tip of the paint is over the area to
be filled
4. Click on the mouse button to fill the area with the current foreground
colour (if you right click you can fill with the background colour)
The Eraser

To remove part of your picture an eraser is provided. Essentially this acts
like the brush except that it always uses the background colour. Usually, a
picture is on a white background so, before the eraser is used, the
background colour should be set back to white. If you have a different
background colour, choose that instead.
1. Right click on the white colour in the palette to reset the background
colour
2. Click on the [Eraser/Color Eraser] toolbox button (to the left of [Fill
with Color])

You now have a selection of 4 different eraser sizes (4, 6, 8 or 10 pixels
wide) below the toolbox. The default size is 8 pixels.
3. Select the size of rubber required - the chosen rubber is shown as
white
4. Move the mouse cursor onto the canvas (it becomes a small square in
the background colour)
5. Position the cursor above the area to be erased then hold down the
mouse button and move the mouse around - the pixels turn to white
6. Release the mouse button when you have finished using the eraser
Note that you can erase the whole picture by using Select All from the Edit
menu (or press <Ctrl a>) then pressing <Delete>. You can restore your
picture with Undo (press <Ctrl z>) if you want to try this out here. A further
Undo will restore what you have erased.
Selecting an Area

If you select part of your picture, you can apply commands just to that area.
You can also copy or move a selected area. There are two selection tools a rectangular and a freeform one.
1. Click on the rectangular [Select] button above [Fill with Color]
2. Move the mouse cursor onto the canvas and position it at one corner of
the area to be selected
3. Hold down the mouse button and drag out a rectangle over the
required area
4. When the rectangle is correct, release the mouse button - handles
appear around the selection
Warning: You can use the handles to adjust the area precisely. However, if
you decrease the area of selection then the part cut off is repainted using
the background colour. If you enlarge the area then there's no problem.
Now try issuing commands to effect just the selection:
5. Open the Image menu and choose Invert Colors - the colours in that
area are inverted
6. Repeat step 5 to reset them back to their original state
7. Move the mouse cursor into the area (it becomes a four-headed cross),
hold down the mouse button and drag the area around
8. Repeat step 7 but this time hold down the <Ctrl> key - a duplicate area
appears (you could also use Copy and Paste)

This new area is now the current selection and any command you issue will
be applied to it.
9. Press the <Delete> key - the selected area is replaced by the current
background colour
The selection handles have now disappeared, so you can't make any
further changes.
Now try out the [Free-Form Selection] tool. With this you can draw a
freeform area around an object to select it. It works like the pencil (and is as
difficult to control - until you get used to it).
10. Click on the [Free-Form Selection] button
11. Position the mouse cursor where you want to begin the selection then
hold down the mouse button and draw freehand around the area
required
12. Release the mouse button to end the selection - a rectangle covering
the selected area appears but the exact area is not shown
13. Move the mouse cursor into the rectangle and drag the selected area
to a new position
14. When the position is correct, click outside the rectangle to release the
selection
It's very difficult to select an area precisely using this tool at this level of
magnification. To make more accurate adjustments, use should be made of
the zoom facility (see later).
Rotation and Stretch

A selected area can also be rotated or enlarged. To demonstrate this:
1. Click on the [Select] button and select a small area of your canvas - eg
the text
2. Now open the Image menu and select Flip/Rotate... - the following
window appears

3. Keep the selected option as Flip horizontal (press <Return> for [OK])
- your selection is turned into a mirror image
4. Now repeat steps 2 and 3 but this time choose Flip vertical - your
selection is turned upside down and is now readable again (if you
stand on your head!)
You can reverse the above by repeating the two flips - or you can rotate the
selection through 180º.
5. Repeat steps 2 and 3 but this time choose Rotate by angle and set this
to 180º
You can try rotating through 90º or 270º, if you like. Take care with this as
unless the selection is perfectly square you'll find that the part of your
picture is coloured in the current background colour.
Next try stretching your selection:
6. Open the Image menu and select Stretch/Skew... - the following
window appears:

Here you can increase the horizontal or vertical dimensions by whatever
percentage you choose, or you can skew the selection horizontally or
vertically by a given number of degrees.
7. Under Stretch set Horizontal to 150% - press <Return> for [OK]
8. Reposition the selection, if necessary, then click away from it to end
the editing

Precision Drawing
Mention has previously been made of the grid upon which a picture is
based. As you move the mouse over the canvas, the coordinates of the
current grid position are displayed. Similarly, when you draw an object such
as a rectangle, you can use the grid to define the size precisely.
If you employ the magnifier, you can zoom right in to see the single pixels
which form the grid. At this scale you can draw an object with precision and
can edit each pixel individually. You can also select an object and move it to
the exact position required.
The Magnifier

One of the two remaining tools in the toolbox is a magnifier. This lets you
zoom in to see the individual pixels.
1. Click on the [Magnifier] - a choice of 4 magnifications appears below
the toolbox
2. For maximum zoom select 8x - the individual pixels can be seen
3. Using the scroll bars, move around the picture to see how individual
objects are drawn

Now try drawing at this level of magnification:
4. Click on the [Line] button and select the thinnest style of line (1 pixel
wide)
5. Draw a line, as you did earlier, and note how the pattern of pixels
changes as you move the mouse around - release the mouse button
when the line is roughly diagonal (45º)
6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 but this time select the thickest line style (5 pixels
wide)
Now try changing the colour of the lines:
7. Select a different foreground colour from the colour palette
8. Click on the [Fill with Color] button, move the tip of the mouse cursor
onto the thick line and click the mouse button - the whole line is
recoloured
9. Repeat step 8 on the thin line - you'll find you can only recolour one or
two pixels at a time (because they do not form a contiguous area)
10. Click on the [Pencil] button and try drawing freehand - you can click on
individual pixels if you find your control still isn't very good (or right click
to erase a mistake)
Finally, try selecting an irregular area - eg one of your new lines:
11. Click on the [Free-Form Select] button
12. Position the mouse cursor as close as possible to the line, hold down
the mouse button and draw carefully around the line to select it - the
black line marks the selection
Note that you don't have to completely encircle it - if you don't return to your
starting position, the selection is completed by a straight line drawn from the
end position back to the start.
13. Check that the background colour matches that next to the line - reset
it if necessary
14. Move the mouse cursor into the selection area and drag the text to its
new position
The above exercise should have taught you a lot more about exactly how a
picture is formed. It also should have shown you how you can edit your
picture with the greatest accuracy.

Displaying the Grid

When you are doing accurate drawing or edits like the above, it's useful to
be able to see the actual grid. By default this is not shown - you can just
see groups of pixels, some of which may be a single pixel in size or width.
To view the grid:
1. Open the View menu and choose Zoom
2. From the submenu which appears select Show Grid - the grid is now
displayed
Note that the grid can only be displayed if the magnification is set to 4x or
higher. To hide the grid:
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 (or press <Ctrl G>) - this time the grid
disappears
4. End by returning the magnification to normal - either use Normal Size
from the Zoom submenu or click on the [Magnifier] button and choose
1x
Tip: You can also use <Ctrl Page Down> and <Ctrl Page Up> to switch
between normal magnification and large (which is defined as 4x).

Changing the Colours
You are not restricted to using the colours provided in the palette - you can
choose from the full colour spectrum. Though the palette holds only 28
colours at a time, you can use many more than this in your picture, if you
want to. Paint provides you with a selection of 48 basic colours, to which
you can add a further 16 custom colours. These in turn can be redefined,
giving you an endless range of different shades.
If you do need to use more colours than can be accommodated in the
palette, then Paint provides you with a simple mechanism for selecting
colours currently not in the palette from your canvas.
Modifying the Colour Palette

To change a palette colour:
1. Left click on the colour in the palette which you want to change
2. Open the Colors menu and select Edit Colors... - the Edit Colours
window appears:
3. Select the colour required from the 48 Basic colors then press
<Return> for [OK]

Note that this just changes the colours available on the palette - it doesn't
affect your picture at all. To select a colour which does not appear in the 48
basic colours:
4. Repeat steps 1 and 2 then click on [Define Custom Colors >>]

5. Click in the rainbow as close as possible to the colour required
6. Fine tune the colour by modifying the values in the boxes below - the
end result is shown in the Color/Solid box (if two colours are shown,
the right-hand one is what will be shown on a screen set to 256-colour
display)
Here isn't really the place to discuss how colours are constituted but
basically any colour is a combination of red, green and blue. If these values
are all set at 0 then you get white; if they are all 255 the result is black. The
settings to the left are for the hue, saturation and luminosity. The hue
matches the x-axis of the rainbow (ie a hue of 0 is on the far left) while the
saturation matches the y-axes (0 being along the top). To the right of the
rainbow is a scale which reflects the luminosity (lightness/darkness). This
ranges from 240 at the top to 0 at the bottom.
7. Once you have finalised your colour, click on [Add to Custom Colors]
8. Click on the next empty box in the Custom colors palette the repeat
steps 5 to 7 - make sure Lum isn't set to 240 or the colour will appear
white

9. When you have finished customising your colour palette, press
<Return> for [OK]
Note that you don't have to place a colour in Custom colors (step 7) to use it
- you can move it straight onto your normal palette. The advantage of
having a custom colour palette is that you can easily pick up a colour from it
if it's no longer present in the normal palette. The alternative to this is to use
the [Pick Color] tool.
Picking a Colour

If you have used a colour in your picture which isn't stored on any of the
palettes, you can set the foreground or background colour to it using the
[Pick Color] tool. You can also use this tool to pick up any colour off the
canvas, without selecting it from a palette.
1. Click on the [Pick Color] tool (below the [Eraser])
2. Position the mouse cursor above a pixel containing the colour you want
to use
3. Click on the mouse button to set the foreground colour (or right click to
set the background colour) - you will find this now matches the selected
pixel

Saving your Picture
When you have finished drawing your picture you can save it in a file. This
can then be loaded into another application or used as wallpaper for the
background to your Desktop. Files can be saved in various formats,
including a bitmap (.bmp), gif or jpeg. To save your picture:
1. Open the File menu and choose Save
2. Supply a File name: - note that pictures are held in the My Pictures
folder by default
3. Set Save as type: as required (see below)
4. Press <Return> for [Save]
The file type you select will influence the size of the resultant file. A 24-bit
Bitmap file will be considerably larger than a 256-Color Bitmap one but
some colour definition may be lost. The jpeg format compresses a 24-bit file
considerably, while a gif format compresses a 256-colour file and produces
by far the smallest file. A Monochrome Bitmap is even smaller but colour is
lost completely. No matter which file type you choose, you should be able to
insert your picture into another application without a problem.

Saving Part of a Picture

If you want to export part of a picture to a different file, you can do so by
selecting the area and then saving it. You can also import another file into
your current picture.

Saving your Picture as Wallpaper

Another option which is available if you have your own PC is to save your
picture as wallpaper. The picture is then used for the Desktop background.
Note that you can't do this on the public machines.
1. Open the File menu and select Set as Background (Centred)
2. Now click on the [Show Desktop] button on the Task Bar (to the right
of Start)
You'll find the picture appearing in the middle of the screen. If you wanted it
to fill the whole screen you'd have to enlarge the canvas. An alternative is to
have multiple copies of your picture across the Desktop.
3. Return to Paint by clicking on its Task Bar button
4. Open the File menu and select Set as Background (Tiled)
5. Repeat step 2 - you should find multiple copies of your picture across
the Desktop

If you don't want your picture as wallpaper for the Desktop:
6. Open the Start menu and choose Settings then Control Panel
7. Double click on the Display icon
8. On the Background tab in the Display Properties window, scroll up to
the top of the list and select None
9. Press <Return> for [OK] - the Desktop returns to normal
10. [Close] the Control Panel window

Inserting a Paintbrush Picture
To insert a Microsoft Paint picture into an Office application (ie a Word
document, PowerPoint presentation, Excel spreadsheet or on an Access
form), start by loading up the required application:
1. Open the Windows Start menu, select Programs then Microsoft
Office and finally, the required application - eg Microsoft Word
2. If you want to insert the picture into an existing file, Open it then move
the insertion point (typing position) to the required place
3. Now open the Insert menu and select Picture then From File...
4. Select the required picture then press <Return> for [Insert]
Note that you can also copy (or cut) a picture directly from Microsoft Paint
into the Office application. To copy the whole picture, first press <Ctrl a> (or
use Select All from the Edit menu) then switch into the Office application
and use Paste. You can also use Paint's [Select] tool to copy part of a
picture, if you don't want it all.
5. [Close] the application (ie Word) - don't bother saving the changes to
the file unless you want them
6. End the session by closing down Paint - click on the Close window
button or choose Exit from the File menu.
